    <p class="about_me">Hi! The name is Frederikke and I am currently a student at KEA studying to become an IT-architect.
  Previously I have been working as an ordinary seaman for a few years, before jumping ships (lol) to become a boat builder.
  However little Miss Covid-19 did put a hold to that, since it is pretty hard to build a boat in a small apartment with a marline spike as your only tool .
  Therefore I chose to become a jack-of-all-trades within a TV-production company.
      I was there for five years until I found out I wanted to pursue the sweet sweet IT profession.
